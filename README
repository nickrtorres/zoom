`zoom` is a CLI app to open a zoom link from a json file on disk. You must
point `zoom` to your json file with the environment variable 'ZOOM_ROOMS'. Once
this is set, invoke `zoom` and pass a room id to it. This will open the link
that matches the id or fail with an error.

For simplicity, this only works on macOS as it relies on `open(1)`.

Example json file
-----------------
{
  "my-room": "<your zoom link here>"
}

Example invocation
------------------
% zoom my-room
